# Fortémi Test Database Image
#
# PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector + PostGIS for CI/CD testing.
# Combines extensions needed for matric-memory migrations.
#
# Usage:
#   docker build -f build/Dockerfile.testdb -t matric-testdb:local .
#   docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=matric matric-testdb:local
#
# Extensions included:
#   - pgvector: Vector similarity search (from base image)
#   - PostGIS: Spatial queries for provenance tracking
#   - pg_trgm: Trigram search (built into PostgreSQL)
#
# Note: pg_bigm (CJK bigram search) requires external repos and is optional.
# The application gracefully falls back to pg_trgm when pg_bigm is unavailable.
