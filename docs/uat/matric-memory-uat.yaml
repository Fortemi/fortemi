# DEPRECATED - Use the 22-phase UAT plan instead
# =============================================================================
#
# This file has been superseded by the phase-based UAT executor:
#
#   tests/uat/matric-memory-uat-executor.md     (master index)
#   tests/uat/phases/*.md                       (22 individual phase files)
#
# The phase-based plan covers 420+ tests across 22 phases (vs ~250 here)
# and includes phases for file attachments, memory search, document types,
# templates, versioning, archives, SKOS, PKE, jobs, observability, OAuth,
# caching, feature chains, and data export.
#
# Do NOT use this file for new UAT runs.
