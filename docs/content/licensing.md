# Licensing

Fortemi is licensed under the **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)** with a change date of **February 16, 2030**, after which it converts to **AGPL v3** (GNU Affero General Public License).

This page explains what that means in plain English.

## The Short Version

- **Personal use is free.** Always. No license key, no time bomb, no asterisks.
- **Small teams, students, researchers, open-source folks** — you're welcome here.
- **Commercial/multi-user production deployments** need a license. We keep pricing fair.
- **Fully open source on February 16, 2030.** Every version, automatically.

## What You Can Do (No License Needed)

Use Fortemi freely for:

- **Personal projects** — your notes, your research, your ideas, your laptop
- **Educational purposes** — classes, coursework, teaching, academic research
- **Evaluation** — test it, benchmark it, see if it fits
- **Desktop use** — personal productivity, journaling, writing
- **Development** — fork it, modify it, experiment, contribute back
- **Solo use at work** — running it on your own machine for your own notes

No license required. No questions asked. No usage tracking.

## What Requires a License

You need a commercial license if you:

- **Deploy on shared infrastructure** for multiple users in your organization
- **Offer it as a service** to customers (hosted knowledge base, SaaS)
- **Embed it in a commercial product** that you sell
- **Run it in production** as part of business operations for a team

The line is simple: **one person on their own machine = free. Multiple users on shared servers = license.**

## FAQ

### Can I use this for my personal notes?

**Yes.** That's exactly what it's for. Run it however you like — Docker, bare metal, your home server. It's free.

### Can I use it at work on my laptop?

**Yes.** If it's just you using it on your own machine, that's personal use. No license needed, even if your notes are work-related.

### I'm a student / researcher. Do I need a license?

**No.** Academic and educational use is free. Use it for your thesis, your lab, your research group.

### Can I use this at my 6-person startup?

**Yes — reach out to us.** We want to support small teams and early-stage companies. [Open an issue](https://github.com/fortemi/fortemi/issues) and we'll work out something affordable. We're not trying to price anyone out.

### Can I deploy it for my 50-person company?

**That needs a commercial license.** But the process is simple — [contact us](https://github.com/fortemi/fortemi/issues) and we'll get back to you within 2–3 business days.

### Can I fork and modify the code?

**Yes.** Fork it, change it, improve it. Your modifications stay under BSL 1.1 (same terms). We'd love it if you contributed changes back.

### When does it become fully open source?

**February 16, 2030.** On that date, every version of Fortemi — past, present, and future — automatically converts to AGPL v3. No more production restrictions for anyone.

### Can I use this in a SaaS product?

**Requires a commercial license.** Hosting Fortemi (or a derivative) as a service for customers is production use.

### Can I integrate my open-source project with Fortemi?

**Yes.** Your project can call Fortemi's API freely. If you embed/bundle Fortemi itself, your project needs to respect the BSL terms (or wait for the AGPL conversion in 2030).

### What happens to my commercial license after 2030?

**It stays valid.** But after February 16, 2030, anyone can use Fortemi for production under AGPL v3 — so you might not need to renew.

## Commercial Licensing

We keep things simple and fair.

### Pricing Philosophy

We're a small project that wants to grow sustainably. Our licensing reflects that:

## Open Source Conversion

### Change Date: February 16, 2030

On this date, Fortemi automatically converts from BSL 1.1 to **AGPL v3**:

- **No more production restrictions** — anyone can deploy for any purpose
- **Full AGPL v3 freedoms** — use, modify, distribute freely
- **Copyleft requirement** — derivatives must also be AGPL v3
- **All versions included** — past and future releases are AGPL v3

### Why BSL + AGPL?

1. **Sustainability** — commercial licenses fund full-time development
2. **Fairness** — free for individuals, affordable for teams, licensed for large orgs
3. **Guaranteed open source** — the conversion date is baked into the license, not a promise
4. **Anti-parasitic** — large cloud providers can't take and resell without contributing back

### What is AGPL v3?

The GNU Affero General Public License v3 is a copyleft open source license. It works like the GPL but also covers network use: if you run modified AGPL software as a web service, you must share your source code with users of that service.
